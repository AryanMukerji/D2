# ```D2: Blockchain Based Secure Donation System```
Our project, D2: Blockchain Based Secure Donation System (where D2 is the abbreviation of ***Donate Too*** ), focuses on solving the prevalent issue of misutilization of money that is collected for donations. Money that is collected for a good cause might not be utilized in the desired way. Also, there are situations wherein the third party that is responsible for transferring the money to the person might be fraudulent. Due to these reasons, people tend to take a backseat while donating money, even for a good cause.
